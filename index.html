     <p> 	Justin Drew Bieber (/ˈbiːbər/; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer, songwriter and actor.[6] Discovered at 13 years old by talent manager Scooter Braun after he had watched his YouTube cover song videos, Bieber was signed to RBMG Records in 2008. With Bieber's debut EP My World, released in late 2009, Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut record chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[7]</p>
<p>Bieber released his debut studio album My World 20 in 2010. It debuted at number one in several countries and contained the worldwide hit single "Baby", which was certified 12x Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[8] Following his debut album and promotional tours, he released his 3D biopic-concert film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. In years after the releases of the Under the Mistletoe (2011) and Believe (2012), Bieber had several run-ins with the law internationally before his first arrest in 2014, including when he was accused of reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, and charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013.[9] More than 270,000 people petitioned the White House seeking to have him deported from the United States. Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to require a response under published White House guidelines, the Obama Administration declined substantive comment on the petition.[10]</p>
